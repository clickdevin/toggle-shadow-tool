[![works badge](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikku/works-on-my-machine/v0.2.0/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nikku/works-on-my-machine)

A simple addon that adds a tool to enable and disable render-to-texture shadows in Garry's Mod.

[Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157560152)

## Usage
 - Use primary fire to disable the shadow on an object.
 - Use secondary fire to re-enable a shadow.
 - Use reload to toggle the shadow of an object as well as any constrained objects.
 - Disable all shadows from the option in the Tool menu.

## Compatibility
This addon probably shouldn't interfere with other addons. It it intended to run in Sandbox mode, but it will probably work in any gamemode that is based on Sandbox mode and retains the Tool Gun.

This addon has Duplicator support.
